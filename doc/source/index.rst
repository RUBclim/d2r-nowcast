D2R Nowcasting Service Manual
=============================


Extreme heat poses risks to human health, well-being, and public spaces.
The `ICLEI Action Fund 2.0 <https://iclei-europe.org/funding-opportunities/action-fund/>`__ project Data2Resilience aims to enhance Dortmundâ€™s heat resilience through a three-part approach: measurement, modelling, and communication.
D2R is collaborating with the city of Dortmund to co-deploy a **state-of-the-art biometeorological sensor network**, that measures the air temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, and mean radiant temperature.
To monitor thermal discomfort across the city, D2R developed a nowcasting service that models the **Universal Thermal Climate Index (UTCI) at street level resolution**,
using as a basis the biometeorological weather station data and numerical weather predictions from DWD.
At its core, the nowcasting service uses the Urban Multi-scale Environmental Predictor (UMEP).
Specifically, the SOLWEIG model is utilized for thermal comfort calculations.
The final product of the nowcasting service is an interactive dashboard (:numref:`dashboard`) whose features and maps are developed according to the collected requirements and feedback from stakeholders.
